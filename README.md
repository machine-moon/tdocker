# TDocker

TDocker is a suite of Docker Compose setups designed to simplify application deployment on an NGINX network. This repository includes configurable environments for various applications, such as code editors, file management systems, databases, and more.

## Overview

This project contains several Docker containers, each with its configuration, designed to work together within an NGINX network. Among these are:

- **Code Server**: A web-based code editor based on Visual Studio Code.
- **File Browser**: A simple file management tool to easily access and manage files.
- **Jupyter Lab**: An interactive environment for running Jupyter notebooks.
- **KeeWeb**: A web application for managing your passwords securely.
- **Ollama**: A toolkit for running machine learning models.
- **Portainer**: A management UI for Docker.

## Features

- **NGINX Proxy**: All services can be accessed through a unified NGINX server for easier management.
- **SSL**: Self-signed certificates for secure HTTPS access.
- **User/Group Configuration**: The user and group ID are set to `1002:1002` for proper permissions across containers.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/machine-moon/tdocker.git
   cd tdocker
   ```
3. Configure the NGINX settings:
   - Replace `XXXX` in the NGINX configuration file in the `nginx` directory with your actual domain or IP address as required.

4. Start the application stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Usage

- Access the services via the NGINX server on ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS).
- Each service is documented within its respective directory.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that you configure the NGINX settings properly to avoid any security issues.
- This setup is intended for personal or development use. If you plan to deploy on a production environment, consider additional security measures.
